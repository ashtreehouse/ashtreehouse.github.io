# Welcome

_A family home at Ash Tree House_ is an account of our lives as a young family learning to live on one income while still making plenty of memories.  
We don't claim to know everything, and are sure to make mistakes, but we plan to use this space to document and reflect our journey, and hopefully we'll learn from it in the future and maybe even help others too.

## A little background

We met in 2006 and after 9 months of dating moved into our first home together. In 2009 we got married, in 2013 we moved to our current home and started to try for a family. Our journey to parenthood has been tough but we're so glad to be the parents of two beautiful children. When our first daughter was born in 2017 I stopped working as a nurse to focus my attentions on child rearing and being a mum. The ensuing loss of income has meant we've had to reconsider our spending patterns, and while we hope to make another big life change in the coming years our financial situation will be changing again. 

We look forward to sharing our story with you,

Nat & Matt
