For anyone who's trying to save money creating a meal plan is unlikely to be groundbreaking, it means that we buy food that is needed to create a balanced diet without buying food that we don't need leading to the food being wasted, therefore wasting money and is also *really* bad for the environment. Despite knowing this and having lived this it's still something we have struggled to do every day, week in and week out. We've always found that life gets in the way, when we had planned a weeks worth of meals in the past we tended to be over ambitious and have a list of meals that required lots of cooking and extensive ingredient lists. Great on paper, like going to a nice restaurant and looking at a delicious menu! Unfortunately in the real world, someone has to prepare all that food and that's not always possible. The other thing that has held us back in following a meal plan is our love of eating out and changing plans at the last minute *"Hey the weather's great today, fancy coming round for a BBQ?"* or *"Hey it's been a long time, do you wanna catch up over dinner at a pub/restaurant?"*. And of course in the second scenario we end up spending on food twice, for the food we have at home that we will *hopefully* eat at a later date but may end up destined for the bin and paying for the food we buy eating out.

Not only does meal planning save us money, it also saves the stress of not knowing what to cook each day and ensuring we have all the ingredients required. Crucial when feeding two gorgeous albeit demanding children when running out to the shops to buy food for dinner can cause a lot of upset. Having this plan means that we are less likely in a moment of "I don't know what to cook tonight" exasperation fall back on going out to eat or buying takeaway.

Since the beginning of January we have been trialling a 4 week rolling meal plan, I started with a Sunday roast, then planned for a meal on the Monday to use leftover meat. Saturday nights are usually "fakeaway night" as one of us is usually able to spend a bit more time cooking while the other entertains the children. We plan a different cuisine each week varying between things like Indian, Chinese, Tex Mex, and fish and chips. One night a week is a cheat meal, something with minimal prep needed. This leaves 3 nights a week to plan other favourite meals and by writing a 4 week plan means that if a meal doesn't make the cut in week one or two then we can usually fit it in weeks 3 or 4. By having a rolling 4 week plan means that I don't have the feeling of being overwhelmed in week 4 about having to start another meal plan, we just restart. It is flexible so we have also swapped some meals between the months.

Meal planning combined with doing online shopping, which means less temptation and being able to check the cupboards and fridge as I order our food shopping and I think it's starting to make a difference financially. We have further to go,  but the knowledge of what we are cooking that night is definitely reducing daily stress levels. I would say it has been successful, although I wonder how it will fare in the future when being able to socialise and go out for meals will be allowed again.

I will be posting more about our 4 week meal plan and some of our favourite meal ideas in future posts.

As always
