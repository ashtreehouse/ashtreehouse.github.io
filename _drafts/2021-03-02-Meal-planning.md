For anyone who's trying to save money creating a meal plan is unlikely to be groundbreaking. Despite knowing this and having lived this it's still something we struggle to do every day, week in and week out. Not only does meal planning save us money, it also saves the stress of not knowing what to cook each day and ensuring we have all the ingredients required. Crucial when feeding two gorgeous albeit demanding children when running out to the shops to buy food for dinner can cause a lot of upset. Previous attempts to meal plan have always failed due in part to laziness and lack of perserverence and also real life catching up with us and getting in the way of the best laid plans.  I've been trialling a 4 week meal plan during this past lockdown, combined with doing online shopping and I think it's starting to make a difference. We have further to go but the knowledge of what we are cooking that night is definitely reducing stress levels. I would say it has been mostly successful, although I wonder how it will fare in the future when being able to socialise and go out for meals will be allowed again.

I'm not really one to make new year's resolutions, but this year we decided to make a commitment to reduce our meat consumption, especially cutting back on red meat to hopefully reduce our carbon footprint. 10 weeks in and we've been thriving on a Sunday roast dinner that usually consists of a Chicken and then using the leftovers to make a meal on Monday and cooking up the carcass to make a stock which we freeze for a later meal. For the rest of the week we eat vegetarian meals, and I can honestly say that we haven't missed eating meat every day and when we do eat meat we've found it to be so much tastier. We've also been eating a lot more vegetables, so I'd say it's a win-win all round. 

>*I took time researching suitable vegetable and plant based protein alternatives and consulted medical advice before making the change to reduce meat from our meals. We still eat and drink dairy products as with a baby, a breastfeeding mum and a preschooler ensuring a balanced diet is crucial for healthy growth, especially taking into account the food groups and nutrients that are usually consumed through meat, specifically but not limited to protein, calcium, vitamin d and iron. I would advise anyone who is planning on a major diet change where you omit food groups to speak with a dietician or other medical professional first, especially if feeding young children and babies, pregnant or breastfeeding.* 

I will be posting more about our 4 week meal plan and meal ideas in future posts. 

As always
